Practice exercise to make a custom text editor with the simplest possible functionality.

Will run in the user's local web browser on desktop or mobile, with responsive display.

The user can:

-   Create a new document.
-   Edit it.
-   Save the document to local storage.
-   Load existing documents and perform the same tasks.
-   Potential for expansion in the future, but just these very basics for now. "The Scrivener of plaintext editors" is the pipedream for this one.

##### Deadline for completion:

13 January 2023.

#### Features to be added at some point:

This app's menu bar will allow the user to control the aspects that are most commonly tucked away inside sub-menus.

E.g.:

-   a Light/Dark mode button will be on the Menu Bar from the outset.
-   Also a font-size control button (up to a max size and down to a min size).

*   Menu bar will be at bottom on mobile devices.

Dones and Todos:

Saturday 7-1-23:

Got light/dark mode button half-working. (Next time: get the text area changing too.)

Intention for now is just to get the basic functionality working before starting in on the fine-tuning for desktop/mobile display and usage etc.

Decision whether to leave with basic beginner-JS sort of setup, or use modules/webpack and the like. (Probably the former. This is an exercise in making something first and foremost. Not packaging for production.)
