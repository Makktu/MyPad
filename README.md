# MyPad

Practice exercise to make a custom text editor with the simplest possible functionality.

Will run in the user's local web browser on desktop or mobile, with responsive display.

The user can:

* Create a new document.
* Edit it.
* Save the document to local storage.
* Load existing documents and perform the same tasks.
* Potential for expansion in the future, but just these very basics for now. "The Scrivener of plaintext editors" is the pipedream for this one.

##### Deadline for completion:
13 January 2023.
